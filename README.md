Synopsis:\
A mobile dice rolling app for Android. This was a companion app I made for the Pathfinder games my friend would host. You could select any of the standard die in a D20 set. You could then flick your phone and it would roll the dice on screen. The subsequent totals of each of the individual dice would be displayed in the upper coner. You could also save and name combinations of dice you'd use more often.

Purpose:
* Learn how to communicate inputs from the Androids accelerometer to the app
* Translate the force from a shake to the dice to apply impact and movement
* Learn how to accurately model D20 dice, texture, and import from blender to unity
* Figure out a way to save combinations of dice for ease of access

Software and Equipment:
* Unity Engine - C#
* Android Phone
* Blender
